Numbers:
'Number' turns strings into Numbers
 - string = '~text in-between quotes'

 addition is an operator that will combine two strings together.
ex:
    let num1 = '76';
    let num2 = '6';
    console.log(Number(num1) + Number(Num2));
    = 76

    let num1 = '76';
    let num2 = '6';
    console.log(num1 + Num2);
    = 766
    
    let greeting = 'Hello ';
    let name = 'Chris';
    console.log(greeting + name);
    = 'Hello Chris'

javascipt does it's math from right to left, thus changing the values of variables

(===) vs (==)
    - (==) compares two variables despite datatype
    - (===) compares two variables but checks datatype

assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=):
    
x += y is the same as x = x + y
    x -= y is the same as x = x - y
    x *= y is the same as x = x * y
    xx /= y is the same as x = x / y

template literals:
    templates literals must use backticks ``
    they allow embedded expressions called subtitutions
    use ${*/ variable } to call variable / function

    let greeting = 'Hello';
    let name = 'Chris';
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`)
    = Hello Chris

    or

    let greeting = 'Hello ';
    let name = 'Chris';
    console.log(greeting + name)

    or

    let nameQuestion = prompt('What is your name?');
    const greeting = 'Hello';
    const endOfGreeting = 'how are you?';
    name = nameQuestion
    alert(`${greeting} ${name}, ${endOfGreeting},`)
    = Hello (name), how are you?

    You can also use /n to create multiples lines of text.
    console.log('string test line 1\n' + 'string text line 2')

    Data-types in Javascript:

        - number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by Â±(253-1).

         - bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
         
         - string for strings. 
    
         - A string may have zero or more characters, there's no separate single-character type.
    
         - boolean for true/false.
    
         - null for unknown values - a standalone type that has a single value null.
    
         - undefined for unassigned values - a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
    
         - object for more complex data structures.
    
         - symbol for unique identifiers.

function main(){
    let answer = 'TheMaster';
    let password = prompt('Enter a password')
        if (password == 'TheMaster'){
            alert('Welcome Gavin');
        }
        else if (password == 'Cancel') {
            alert('Cancelled');
            menu()
        }
        else {
            alert('Wrong password')
            main()
        }
    }
        
function menu(){
    let action = prompt('Who\'s there?');
        if (action == 'Admin') {
        main()
        }
        else if (action == 'Cancel') {
            alert('Good-Bye!');
        }
        
        else {
            alert('I don\'t know you??')
        menu()
        }
}
        
menu()
